Hello, my name I Anthony, Iâ€™ve been developing a passion for cybersecurity. In all my work experiences I have found that being able to help people has been one of my main drivers in work and life. I find that cybersecurity gives me the tools to help thousands of individuals and companies from malicious threat actors. I can mitigate and prevent sensitive information from getting into the wrong hands by following the proper procedures. 

Strengths:
I have a couple of strengths that I bring to the table. Verbal and written communication has been the foundation of being successful in whatever field I was in. For cybersecurity explaining technical concepts to clients or coworkers use strong verbal communication skills to enable them to articulate these ideas clearly and effectively.

Values: 
Adhering to ethical principles draws me into this line of work. Cybersecurity for me is all about honesty. I can keep threat actors accountable and stop them from gaining more PII or SPII information. 

The idea of safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring the privacy and security of individuals and organizations is what drives my passion for cybersecurity. I believe that upholding ethical standards in cybersecurity practices, will mitigate risks and prevent potential harm but also contribute to building a safer and more secure digital environment for everyone.

My current goal is to become a cybersecurity analyst in New Mexico or perhaps relocate depending on the job.
